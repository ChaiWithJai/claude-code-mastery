### Announcement Post (Choose One)

**Template A: Transformation Story**

```
Just completed Claude Code Mastery.

Before:
• Single-file autocomplete
• Starting fresh every session
• Generic AI suggestions

After:
• Skills that encode my expertise
• Compound knowledge across projects
• Domain-aware AI that knows my patterns

The shift from "AI assistant" to "AI that works like I do" is real.

Key insight: The soul lives in prompts, not code.

Thanks @JaiBhagat for the course.

```

**Template B: Specific Win**

```
Built my first Claude Code skill today: [skill name]

It encodes [what it does].

Now instead of explaining my [code review/architecture/testing] preferences every time, Claude just knows.

This is the difference between using AI and training AI to work like you.

Learned this in Claude Code Mastery by @JaiBhagat.

#ClaudeCode #ProductivityTips #SoftwareEngineering
```

**Template C: Team Leader Angle**

```
Rolling out Claude Code to my team of [X] engineers.

What sold me:
• Skills encode team best practices (not individual preferences)
• Knowledge compounds (new hires get team expertise immediately)
• LangSmith traces for debugging AI workflows

This isn't about making individuals faster.
It's about encoding institutional knowledge.

Started with Claude Code Mastery - highly recommend for any engineering lead thinking about AI adoption.

Thank you for learning with me.

The goal was never just to teach Claude Code.
It was to show you how to encode your expertise.

What you know is valuable.
Now it compounds.
